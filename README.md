# EmpireTVTool

This is a small tool designed to find the target groups’ preferences in the video game "Empire TV." You simply enter the target groups, and it identifies shared viewing preferences for the program.

Nothing fancy.

##### Some details:
###### I only speak English and German.
That means the program starts in English if your system language is not German. In that case, it also uses the English in-game terms… or the German terms, depending on your system language.
If you have "termcolor" installed (pip install termcolor), the output will be in color.

Feel free to copy, modify, or alter this program in any way you like.
